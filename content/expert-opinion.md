The title refers to a survey regularly cited an indicator of expert consensus on questions of race and intelligence, distributed mainly to psychologists and reported by Heiner Rindermann, David Becker, and Thomas R. Coyle . The survey is not a credible indicator of expert consensus.{% note() %} This was originally a footnote in a [previous post](https://muireall.space/acx/), but it [keeps](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq/cea-statement-on-nick-bostrom-s-email?commentId=G9XPPktpYY7ui43TL) coming [up](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq/cea-statement-on-nick-bostrom-s-email?commentId=KBmfzF3sLHhbFDBaJ), so maybe it's worth turning into a standalone version. {% end %}

An example of how it comes up: in support of a claim that human biodiversity{% note() %}A strain of thought that emphasizes genetic variation, particularly between races, as a causal factor in disparate social outcomes. It's often labeled a euphemism for scientific racism. I feel that reputation is deserved. {% end %} "is probably partially correct or at least very non-provably not-correct", Scott Alexander [cited](https://muireall.space/acx/) a post by [Steve Sailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sailer), [Survey of psychometricians finds iSteve [Sailer's blog at the time] one of 3 best journalistic outlets in the world for intelligence coverage](https://web.archive.org/web/20220612040907/https://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/12/survey-of-psychometricians-finds-isteve.html), which besides the result in the title also calls out the average response to "What are the sources of U.S. black-white differences in IQ?" of 47% genetic (SD=31%).

These results are based on the authors' "Expert Questionnaire on Cognitive Ability", administered as an online survey in 2013–2014, distributed by email invitations to authors who had published in any of several psychology journals covering cognitive ability and to members of the [International Society for Intelligence Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Intelligence_Research), announced at the ISIR annual conference, and posted to the website for the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences.

This is not obviously the best net to cast to find experts on these questions—fewer than half of respondents who stated a field of study fell under "Intelligence and related", and only four were in "Genetics". In any case, the authors have published three papers based on their data, on [international differences](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00399/full), [the Flynn effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310984?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1), and [controversial issues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289619301886).{% note() %}The last of these wasn't published until 2020, which is curious. I'd love to read the reviewer comments. {% end %}

Probably the main problem is that response rates make it all but impossible to interpret this survey as indicative of expert consensus. The response rate for the survey was about 20% (265 of 1345), and it was below 8% (102) for every individual question on which data was published across the three papers, with large variation between questions.

For example, respondents attributed the heritability of U.S. black-white differences in IQ 47% on average to genetic factors. On similar questions about cross-national differences, respondents on average attributed 20% of cognitive differences to genes. On the U.S. question, there were 86 responses, and on the others, there were between 46 and 64 responses.

Meanwhile, Steve Sailer's blog was rated highest for accuracy in reporting on intelligence research–by far, not even in the ballpark of sources that got more ratings (those sources being exactly every mainstream English-language publication that was asked about). It was rated by 26 respondents.

The underlying data isn't available, but this is all consistent with the [(known)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220820221313/https://twitter.com/Pinkerite1/status/1558198957247021059) existence of a contingent of ISIR conference attendees who are likely to follow Sailer's blog and share strong, idiosyncratic views on specifically U.S. racial differences in intelligence.

More cynically, this contingent has a [history](https://kevinabird.github.io/2019/12/18/The-Genetic-Hypothesis-and-Scientific-Racism.html) of putting their [thumb](https://race.undark.org/articles/drapers-millions-the-philanthropic-wellspring-of-modern-race-science) on the scales to make their work seem more mainstream than it is. Part of their project is maintaining an appearance of legitimacy without exposing their network of authorship, review, and publishing to the standards of the broader scientific community. Overrepresenting them was a predictable outcome of distributing this survey, as they would be particularly eager for their views to be counted. [Heiner Rindermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Rindermann) in particular, the first author on these papers, can hardly have failed to consider their existence.

I don't know if I believe the cynical version, but if it's not what they intended, they still nailed it. There are a lot of questions on this survey. I've seen the results cited once to illustrate how much experts disagree, and every other time in defense of human biodiversity.
